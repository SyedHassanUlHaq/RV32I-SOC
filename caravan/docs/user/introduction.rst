Why Caravan?
============

There are fairly limited resources available for the Chisel developers to use pre-built
open-source bus protocols. Even if they are present, they are tightly integrated inside a complex project
or outdated or not properly managed in a single place.

Caravan aims to provide a unified framework for all Chisel based bus protocols that are supported to work on the
FPGAs as well as on the ASIC flow.

**Caravan makes it easier to**

- re-use pre-made bus implementations instead of creating your own
- generate any major (AMBA, Wishbone, TileLink) bus implementation of your choice
- an abstract unified interface to integrate any bus protocol with your design IP
